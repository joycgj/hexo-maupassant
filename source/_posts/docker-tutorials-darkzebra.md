# Docker Tutorial: A Brief Introduction to Docker Virtualization

[Docker Tutorial: A Brief Introduction to Docker Virtualization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umJYDAYxZys&list=PLfpPfDziPdMIbc7p-_siXYwqsRnd3jrLM&index=1&spfreload=10)

Docker is a virtualization technolody.

There are other virtualization technologies like virtualbox and vmware which create virtual computers, virtual machines that run on top of physical hardward. Those are really good because they allow us to run multiple operating systems with multiple capabilities and functionality all on top of one physical piece of hardward, this also makes us more effient in how we use our hardware.

The problem with virtual machines is that you have to run an entire operating system for every virtual machine and so that's where docker comes in. Docker is the idea the ability to virtualize on top of them in one operating system so we can run linux and using technology called linux cantainers. Docker is able to create these bubbles of binaries and functionality that are encapsulated in isolated from the rest of system and that way I can have multiple pieces of virtualization technolofy running on top of one operating system and yet they don't need all the overhead of and entire operating system.
